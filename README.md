# House Prices Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data, the model aims to estimate house prices based on key features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various attributes of houses, including:
- Location
- Number of bedrooms
- Square footage
- Year built

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created additional features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Training**: Used regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluated models using RMSE and R-squared metrics.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the notebook file: `FUTUREINTERNS-ML-01-HOUSE-PRICES-PREDICTION.ipynb`.

## Results
The final model achieved an RMSE of X and an R-squared score of Y on the test set.
